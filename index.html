        <p>About Myself: My name is Levi Cook, I have lived in Kansas my entire life. I am sealed to my wonderful wife,<br>
            whom I met in High School. She is a convert to the church, and a blessing to me in many ways. We have a 2 year<br>
            old girl name Hazel who always puts a smile on our face. We are super excited to continue growing our family with<br>
            another baby girl due in October of 2024. I currently work as a full stack web developer and im looking to further<br>
            my official education by completing my degree. I was born and raised a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of <br>
            Latter-Day Saints and that is a center focus in my life.</p>

        <p>Kansas is a landlocked state, that is widely considered kind of "plain". What people dont know is that Kansas has so much beauty in nature. It has fields, rivers, lakes, flowers, colorful trees, rolling hills and so much more. I have to say though, one of the things I found most beautiful about Kansas after living here my whole life is its sunsets.</p>
