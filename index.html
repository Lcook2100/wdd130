        <p>About Myself: My name is Levi Cook, I have lived in Kansas my entire life. I am sealed to my wonderful wife, whom I met in High School. She is a convert to the church, and a blessing to me in many ways. We have a 2 year old girl name Hazel who always puts a smile on our face. We are super excited to continue growing our family with another baby girl due in October of 2024. I currently work as a full stack web developer and im looking to further my official education by completing my degree. I was born and raised a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and that is a center focus in my life. </p>
